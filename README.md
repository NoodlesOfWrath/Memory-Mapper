# Memory Mapper

## Adding your own Images

This project comes with Images that have already been mapped. But I strongly recommend you try it out with your own images. Here's how you can do it.
1. Make sure the program is closed.
2. Navigate to the project directory and delete the images inside the 'Full_Res_Memories' and 'Memory_Thumbnails' folders.
3. Paste your own images (anything past 100 images won't be displayed)
4. Launch the program. It will say it is not responding, it is mapping the images. Sit tight this could take upwards of 15 minutes.
5. Enjoy!
